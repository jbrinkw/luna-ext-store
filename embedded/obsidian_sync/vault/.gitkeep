# Obsidian Sync - Vault Directory

This directory contains the synced copy of your Obsidian vault.

The sync service automatically copies files from the location specified in `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_LINK` to this directory every 5 minutes.

**Do not manually edit files here** - changes will be overwritten on the next sync. Edit files in your original Obsidian vault instead.
